# Stress-Detection-using-ML-and-Image-Processing-Techniques
The main motive of our project is to detect stress in the IT professionals using vivid Machine learning and Image processing techniques. Our system is an upgraded version of the old stress detection systems which excluded the live detection and the personal counseling but this system comprises of live detection and periodic analysis of employees and detecting physical as well as mental stress levels in his/her by providing them with proper remedies for managing stress by providing survey form periodically. Our system mainly focuses on managing stress and making the working environment healthy and spontaneous for the employees and to get the best out of them during working hours. The proposed System Machine Learning algorithms like KNN classifiers are applied to classify stress. Image Processing is used at the initial stage for detection, the employee’s image is given by the browser which serves as input. In order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it image processing is used by converting image into digital form and performing some operations on it. By taking input as an image and output may be image or characteristics associated with that images. The emotion are displayed on the rounder box. The stress level indicating by Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Sad.
# **Stress Detection Using ML and Image Processing Techniques**

This project detects stress in IT professionals using Machine Learning (ML) and Image Processing techniques. The system applies ML algorithms to classify stress based on periodic analysis of survey responses and live detection through image processing.

---

## **Features**
- **Live Stress Detection**: Detects physical and emotional stress levels through image processing.
- **Survey Form Analysis**: Periodically asks employees to complete a stress survey to help track mental well-being.
- **Image Upload**: Employees upload an image that serves as input for stress detection through facial expression analysis.
- **Stress Classification**: Utilizes Machine Learning techniques such as KNN classifiers to detect and classify stress.
- **Survey Responses**: Collects responses through a periodic survey form with various questions about the user's mental and physical state.

## **Technologies**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Django (Python), OpenCV
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Database**: SQLite (or any Django-compatible database)
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **Forms**: Django Forms
- **Survey Handling**: Custom Django model

## **Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stress-Detection-using-ML-and-Image-Processing-Techniques.git

Survey Response Model Integration
A key component of the project is collecting survey responses from users. The survey includes 15 questions with predefined response choices.


**Model**:
```
python
Copy code
from django.db import models

RESPONSE_CHOICES = [
    ('1', 'Strongly Disagree'),
    ('2', 'Disagree'),
    ('3', 'Neutral'),
    ('4', 'Agree'),
    ('5', 'Strongly Agree'),
]

class SurveyResponseModel(models.Model):
    question1 = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=RESPONSE_CHOICES)
    question2 = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=RESPONSE_CHOICES)
    question3 = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=RESPONSE_CHOICES)
    # Add remaining questions similarly
Form:
The survey form allows users to submit their responses:

python
Copy code
from django import forms
from .models import SurveyResponseModel, RESPONSE_CHOICES

class SurveyResponseForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = SurveyResponseModel
        fields = ['question1', 'question2', 'question3', 'question4', 'question5', 'question6', 'question7', 'question8', 'question9', 'question10', 'question11', 'question12', 'question13', 'question14', 'question15']
        widgets = {
            'question1': forms.Select(choices=RESPONSE_CHOICES),
            'question2': forms.Select(choices=RESPONSE_CHOICES),
            # Add widgets for remaining questions
        }
Usage
Upload an Image: Upload an image through the application interface for stress detection.
Fill Out the Survey: Complete the periodic survey to help track stress levels.
View Results: The system displays the stress levels based on both the image and survey responses.
